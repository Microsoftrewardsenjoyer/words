# Word Bomb Helper
A fast, intelligent substring‑solver that never repeats a word.
This bot scans a full English dictionary, finds every word containing your chosen letter sequence, and serves them to you from longest to shortest — automatically, instantly, and without ever reusing a word until you reset it.
It runs directly in your browser through a sleek, draggable interface you can hide or reveal at any time.
Perfect for word‑games, puzzle‑solving, or stress‑testing obscure English vocabulary.
Features include:
- Automatic word generation as soon as you type a sequence
- Global no‑reuse logic (a word is only used once across all sequences)
- Longest‑to‑shortest ordering
- Draggable, minimal UI with clean aesthetics
- Hide/Show toggle with a compact floating button
- Full dictionary scanning for rare, technical, and monster‑length words
- Reset‑All option to start fresh whenever you want
